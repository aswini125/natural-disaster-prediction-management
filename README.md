# 🌍 Natural Disaster Prediction Management 🌪️

Welcome to the **Natural Disaster Prediction Management** project! This project focuses on predicting and managing natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, and cyclones, using machine learning techniques. Developed as part of the **IBM Nan Mudhalvan** project, it leverages historical data and predictive models to help mitigate disaster risks.

## 🚀 Features

🌟 **Disaster Prediction**: 
- Predicts upcoming natural disasters based on historical data. 
- 🧠 Uses machine learning models to assess risk.

🌍 **Global Data Collection**: 
- Collects disaster-related data from multiple sources.
- 🌐 Integrates public APIs and real-time data for prediction accuracy.

📊 **Risk Assessment & Management**: 
- Provides risk management tools and visualizations.
- 🏙️ Displays heat maps and risk zones for cities and regions.

💻 **Machine Learning Models**: 
- Implements algorithms to predict disaster events.
- ⚙️ Trains models on the disaster data for future predictions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python** (Programming language for ML and data processing)
- 🧮 **Pandas**, **NumPy** (For data manipulation and analysis)
- 🤖 **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning model building)
- 🧠 **TensorFlow/Keras** (For deep learning models, if applicable)
- 📉 **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (For data visualization)
- 🖥️ **Flask/Django** (For building the web interface)
